A brand new game-based CAPTCHA.

## How it works:
The CAPTCHA asks a user to **Remember and Track** the location of a set of random numbers in the Ascending order.
The numbers will disapear after 3 seconds, and they change there location to prevent **pixel-to-pixel comparisons**.


## Why gCAPTCHA?
The idea is via hiding the data, we can confuse the computer wich is (AI) technology, thus the machine can't decide
based on a hidden data.

## How to use?
The CAPTCHA is stil in the developmental phase, it's not implemented with a server-side system.
We hope to be ready as soon as possible.
